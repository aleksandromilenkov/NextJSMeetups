This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I created this app for learning the Next JS framework and MongoDB database.  
I implemented and learned about :  
- Built in server side rendering  
- Simplified routing with file-based routing  
- Adding nested paths and pages  
- Creating Dynamic pages  
- Extracting Dynamic parameters  
- Linking between Pages  
- Static Side Generation (SSG)  
- implementing getStaticProps built in function  
- implementing getServerSideProps built in function
- Prepearing Paths with getStaticPaths  
- implementing API routes  
- Working with MongoDB  
- Sending HTTP Requests to the API Routes  
- Geting data from the mongodb database  
- Adding Head metadata  
- Deploying the project on Vercel
